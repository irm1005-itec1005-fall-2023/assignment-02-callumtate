      <h1>Papillion - the Butterfly dogs </h1>

      <p>
        The Papillion is a breed of dog derived from the European toy spaniel, being named in the 1930's. 
        There name is derived from the French word for butterfly, due to the upright shape of their ears, looking like the shape of butterfly wings. There is also a more common variant, called the phalene, named after the french name for a type of moth. due to the droopy nature of there ears more akin to a moth than that of a butterfly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They are known as a common breed of lapdogs, in the us being ranked as the 51st most common dog breed in 2022, due to there reasonably calm annd friendly nature as a breed, though of course there are exceptions. As they are also a reasonably high energy breed, but adaptable to being either more outdoorsy or more indoors of an animal</p>
